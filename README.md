Philosophy of kosmos-- Don't give away your data. I'm in charge of my data.

**KOSMOS**’s aim is to protect user privacy and help web site or App build the decentralized data collection platform that fully accord with GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Users access log data is anonymously uploaded to decentralized storage system based on the web or APP SDK. Users are identified by block chain wallet uniquely. The use privacy will be fully protected. If web site/app owner and their users consent, these anonymous data could also be shared. People who request data could purchase data usage rights. In order to reflect the value of user data and build an efficient supply and demand relationship between data exporters and data consumers, Kosmos constructs the base platform using block chain technology and uses KMS as the data commodity value to transfer settlement tokens. This platform aims to be decentralized, international, flexible in transaction, transparent in price, and well protected to deliver the value of user data.

Kosmos user data token, or KMS for short, is designed to measure “the value of user data” accurately. KMS is used in trading anonymous user data on the Kosmos platform. The total circulation of KMS is 21 million, and will never be additional issued. This platform could be used to motivate contributors who provide user data. Customers who have a need for user data can also use KMS to purchase data usage rights. KMS hopes to build a standard value expression system based on the quantity demanded of user data and scientific analysis model. Also, KMS as a settlement token calibrates the current and future business value of user data. The user data demanders can easily retrieve the user data resources through KMS platform, locate them and purchase data usage rights.

Kosmos system contain 8 components. The rules of each component is defined and realized by different sub projects:

## 1 [kosmos_developer](https://github.com/KosmosDmp/kosmos_developer)  
  For kosmos developer Community: Any developer of Github can upload the code，design or update the Chrome/APP plugin or special web browser to realize the function of kosmos and collect data. But the output and the basic logic of data replacement cannot be changed. 

## 2 [kosmos_sdk](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_sdk) 
Web or APP SDK. web site or APP owner could use these SDK to collect user data. 

## 3 [kosmos_chrome_plugin](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_chrome_plugin)
Some users may want to share their web visiting logs by themselves. The chrome plugin will meet this requirement. 

## 4 [kosmos_stat](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_stat)
Mainly for web site/app owner. This Statistics Platform should act the function like Google analytics web. 

## 5 [kosmos_mining](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_mining)
Data Contributor is the users of web site/APP. There data is upload to decentralized storage. To encourage data contributor share their data, kosmos set the mining contrac.

## 6 [Kosmos_bid](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_bid)
this project define the rules that how to ‘buy’ the data of kosmos. The user could only buy the data usage rights. The data is ALWAYS belong to data contributors.

## 7 [kosmos_data_platform](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_data_platform)
A platform stores the user data provided by data contributors.

## 8 [Kosmos_proxy](https://github.com/cryptokosmos/kosmos_proxy)
Normally, the SDK like web JS can’t directly upload data to decentralized storage platform. So the proxy is set to connect the SDK and decentralized storage platform.
